#0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
# monty
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Concepts
Stacks (LIFO)
In computer science, a stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top (or the "last" position) of the stack. Think of it like a stack of books: the last book placed on the stack is the first one to be removed.

Queues (FIFO)
A queue is another linear data structure, but it follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear (or the "end") of the queue and removed from the front. Imagine it as a line of people waiting: the person who arrived first is the first to be served.

Project Overview
The Monty Language Generator leverages these fundamental data structures to generate linguistic expressions in a creative and unexpected manner. By manipulating stacks and queues, the program crafts sentences, phrases, and words that reflect the principles of LIFO and FIFO, resulting in a language that is both intriguing and imaginative.

Usage
To use the Monty Language Generator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/EligiblePeace01/monty.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd monty

Run the program and explore the unique language it generates.

Feel free to experiment with the code, modify the data structures, and contribute to the project's development.
